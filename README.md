# DeskFocus
An application to help students focus during study sessions while studying remotely. 

This application is tested to work with MacOs. 

The Website Blocker feature for Windows version requires a minor change in the host path for it to work. 

After downloading the application, run

`sudo python main.py`

Next, enter the same password you use to log into your computer. 
(This step is nessassary as the app needs to gain permission from the computer to block websites.)

DeskFocus is written in Python. 
PyQt5 was used to create the GUI.
The Dictionary feature uses the PyDictionary module. 

Website blocker code was adapted from Sajag Chauhan:
